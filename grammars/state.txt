# To write to the state, include the syntax " @variable_name" 
# within a reference to a nonterminal symbol.

# For instance, the reference <NAME @hero_full_name> causes whatever 
# text segment <NAME> ends up producing to be written to the engine 
# state with the variable name "hero_full_name".

# To read from the state, reference a variable directly, using the 
# syntax "<@variable_name>".

# For instance, the reference <@hero_full_name> causes the string
# stored in the state in the variable "hero_full_name" to be placed
# at the location of the reference.

# If the grammar engine ever encounters a variable that is not in the
# engine state, it will throw an error -- so be sure to only reference
# variables that you know will be defined by the time the engine needs
# to resolve the variable reference.

STORY -> <NAME @hero_full_name> is the hero of this story. <@hero_full_name> left <PLACE @origin> to visit <PLACE @destination>. In <@destination> <@hero_first_name> changed their first name to <FIRST_NAME @hero_first_name>. <@hero_first_name> became <ADJ @feeling> in <@destination> and decided never to return to <@origin>. <@hero_first_name> was <@feeling> for the rest of time. The end!
